See registration page for details.\n\n As you can see from the preliminary program (http://goo.gl/LTfwMF),\n this year's winter school will cover multiple aspects of scientific\n visualization, a topic we hope many of you find\n interesting. Visualization is an integral part of science, and a\n necessity for our understanding of complex processes and data. The\n word itself can have a broad interpretation, including creating\n trivial plots of values, advanced rendering techniques, and complex\n statistical data reasoning. This winter school will target the process\n of understanding data through scientific visualization, and focus on\n extracting knowledge from data. With hands-on exercises, you will\n learn techniques, tools, and best practices for extracting knowledge\n from data. The school is still awaiting confirmation from a couple of\n interesting speakers, so expect that the program will expand in the\n coming time. As in previous years, there will also be a poster session\n on Wednesday, where participants are encouraged to present their own\n research.\n"
