These conclusions are required by  the consideration 3 of Zeno's arguments, in connection with the presumption that an actual entity is an act of experience. The authority of William James can be quoted in support of this conclusion. He writes: \"Either  your experience is of no content, of no change, or it is of a perceptible  amount of content or change. Your acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of perception. Intellectually and on reflection you  can divide these into components, but as immediately given, [106] they  come totally or not at all.\" 4 James also refers to Zeno. In substance I agree  with his argument from Zeno; though I do not think that he allows sufficiently for those elements in Zeno's paradoxes which are the product of  inadequate mathematical knowledge.

Consider, for example, an act of becoming during one second. The act is divisible into two acts, one during the  earlier half of the second, the other during the later half of the second.  Thus that which becomes during the whole second presupposes that  which becomes during the first half-second. Analogously, that which becomes during the first half-second presupposes that which becomes during the first quarter-second, and so on indefinitely. Thus if we consider  the process of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question,  and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever creature  we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated t creature.

Zeno then illegitimately assumes this infinite series of acts of  becoming can never be exhausted. But there is no need to assume that an  infinite series of acts of becoming, with a first act, and each act with an  immediate successor,! is inexhaustible in the process of becoming. Simple  arithmetic assures us that the series just indicated will be exhausted in the  period of one second.

Extension, apart from its  spatialization and temporalization, is that general scheme of relationships  providing the capacity that many objects can be welded into the real unity  of one experience. Thus, an act of experience has an objective scheme of  extensive order by reason of the double fact that its own perspective standpoint has extensive content, and that the other actual entities are objectified with the retention of their extensive relationships. These extensive  relationships are more fundamental than their more special spatial and  temporal relationships. Extension is the most general scheme of real potentiality, providing the background for all other organic relations. The  potential scheme does not determine its own atomization by actual entities. It is divisible; but its real division by actual entities depends upon ",

These conclusions are required by  the consideration 3 of Zeno's arguments, in connection with the presumption that an actual entity is an act of experience. The authority of William James can be quoted in support of this conclusion. He writes: \"Either  your experience is of no content, of no change, or it is of a perceptible  amount of content or change. Your acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of perception. Intellectually and on reflection you  can divide these into components, but as immediately given, [106] they  come totally or not at all.\" 4 James also refers to Zeno. In substance I agree  with his argument from Zeno; though I do not think that he allows sufficiently for those elements in Zeno's paradoxes which are the product of  inadequate mathematical knowledge. But I agree that a valid argument  remains after the removal of the invalid parts. ",

Consider, for example, an act of becoming during one second. The act is divisible into two acts, one during the  earlier half of the second, the other during the later half of the second.  Thus that which becomes during the whole second presupposes that  which becomes during the first half-second. Analogously, that which becomes during the first half-second presupposes that which becomes during the first quarter-second, and so on indefinitely. Thus if we consider  the process of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question,  and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever creature  we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated t creature. Therefore there is nothing which becomes, so as to effect a transition into the  second in question. ",

Zeno then illegitimately assumes this infinite series of acts of  becoming can never be exhausted. But there is no need to assume that an  infinite series of acts of becoming, with a first act, and each act with an  immediate successor,! is inexhaustible in the process of becoming. Simple  arithmetic assures us that the series just indicated will be exhausted in the  period of one second. The way is then open for the intervention of a new  act of becoming which lies beyond the whole series. Thus this paradox of  Zeno is based upon a mathematical fallacy. ",
