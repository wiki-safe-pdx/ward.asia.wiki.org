Individual components seem so fragile.  Entanglements between systems seem so pervasive.  Unknown relationships and dependencies lurk in shadow.  Predicting specific failures is impossible.  Yet it is not impressive to predict that there will be catastrophic failures, cascading failures, unintended consequences.\n"
